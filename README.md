# ITS.ML: Machine learning for intelligent technical systems

Welcome to the repository of the ITS.ML research project. For more information on the project itself, please visit our [homepage](https://its-ml.de/) or get in touch with us on Twitter [@_its_ml](https://twitter.com/_its_ml).

This repository contains the code of all notebooks presented on our homepage, exemplifying how machine learning approaches may be used to address challenges for industrial practice. 

## Installation

To execute any of the noteboks, set up a virtual python environment either using virtualenv [(installation guide)](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) or conda [(installation guide)](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/)

1. Call the environment 'its-ml', so the kernel will be pre-selected in the notebooks
2. The notebooks are tested on python 3.7
