# itsml

## Installation

To execute any of the noteboks, set up a virtual python environment either using virutalenv [(installation guide)](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) or conda [(installation guide)](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/)

1. Call the environment 'its-ml', so the kernel will be pre-selected in the notebooks
2. The notebooks are tested on python 3.7
