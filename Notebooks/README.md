# ITS.ML: Collection of Jupyter Notebooks

This repository contains the code of all notebooks presented on our homepage, exemplifying how machine learning approaches may be used to address challenges for industrial practice.

## Installation

As each notebook requires specific dependencies, we suggest to set up a virtual python environment for running individual notebooks. 
Instructions on how to do so either using virtualenv [(installation guide)](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) or conda [(installation guide)](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) can be found within the README.md of the respective notebook.

Note that all notebooks were tested on python 3.7.
